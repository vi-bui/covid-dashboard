# Covid-19 cases and deaths world comparison

This project involves producing a dashboard to compare the Covid-19 cases and deaths based on the continents. More specifically, comparsions consist of comparing total cases to new cases, as well as total deaths to new deaths. The comparsion between 24/02/22 - 05/03/22 can be visualised. 

Data containing the cases and deaths by country was obtained from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data).
